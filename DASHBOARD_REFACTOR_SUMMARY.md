# Dashboard Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Refactored the dashboard page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) to improve maintainability, reusability, and code organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Custom Hook: `useDashboardData`
**File**: `src/hooks/useDashboardData.ts`

- Extracted all data fetching and state management logic
- Provides typed return values for all dashboard data
- Includes proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Returns:
  - `loading`: Loading state
  - `data`: Full dashboard data object
  - `stats`: Dashboard statistics (typed as `DashboardStats`)
  - `todayPrices`: Today's prices array
  - `productTypes`: Product types array
  - `recentPurchases`: Recent purchases array
  - `topMembers`: Top members array
  - `reload`: Function to reload dashboard data

### 2. Component: `TodayPricesCard`
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/TodayPricesCard.tsx`

- Displays today's prices for all product types
- Includes a button to navigate to the prices management page
- Shows product code, name, and price or "ยังไม่ได้ตั้งราคา" if not set
- Responsive grid layout (2-6 columns depending on screen size)

### 3. Component: `DashboardStatsCards`
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/DashboardStatsCards.tsx`

- Displays three main statistics cards:
  - Today's purchases (count and amount)
  - Month's purchases (count and amount)
  - Total/active members
- Modern design with gradients, icons, and hover effects
- Properly typed with `DashboardStats` interface

### 4. Component: `RecentPurchasesList`
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/RecentPurchasesList.tsx`

- Shows the 5 most recent purchase transactions
- Displays member name, product type, weight, amount, and date
- Empty state with icon and message when no data
- Card-based layout with hover effects

### 5. Component: `TopMembersList`
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/TopMembersList.tsx`

- Shows top members by purchase volume for the current month
- Medal-style ranking (gold, silver, bronze) for top 3
- Displays total weight and amount per member
- Empty state when no data available

### 6. Refactored Main Page
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Before**: 375 lines
**After**: 62 lines (83% reduction!)

The main page is now much cleaner:
- Uses the custom hook for data management
- Renders specialized components for each section
- Authentication check remains in the page component
- Loading state handled with spinner
- Clear section organization with comments

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be used in other pages if needed
3. **Testability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to test
4. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript interfaces throughout
5. **Readability**: Main page is now easy to understand at a glance
6. **Scalability**: Easy to add new sections or modify existing ones

## Notes
